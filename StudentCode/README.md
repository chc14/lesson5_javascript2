### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned how to create a loop with the if, else if, else staeements. By doing this, the values would be determined in successive order of the if statements. If one if didn't meet requirements, it would move to the next one.)
2. (An important part of this assignment was learning how to clear all of the results that javascript created with a simple code. By using the getElementById I was able to change the results back to their original format.)
3. (I learned that by labeling specific areas with an ID, such as Single = 0, those numbers could be used when declaring future parts. By using 0 thru 3 I was able to create different tax percentages for each given area.)
